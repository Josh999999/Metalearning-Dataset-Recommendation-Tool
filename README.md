# Metalearning-Dataset-Recommendation-Tool
Application repository for the proof-of-concept Meta-learning Search Engine developed as a small part of the wider Bournemouth University contribution to the ExtremeXP project.

This tool aims to provide a pipeline where users compare algorithm performance on different datasets, prioritised according to statistical measures of similarity, thereby analysing which algorithms are more likely to be effective for an individual use case.
